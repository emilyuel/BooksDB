# BooksDB
Personal book recommendation project. This project was started 4-Jun-2025.


The main goal of the personal project has since shifted from the original goal of creating a rating system. Instead, I want to develop a recommendation system based on the traits of the book first, the author, and my reading history. Later on, I might add ratings into this (I'm still torn on how much effect a rating should have). 


This is also a project meant to keep me practicing Python and get a better grasp of SQL. I am also trying to minimize the amount of excel to encourage SQL practice.
